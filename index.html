/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

<p>Understanding the educational landscape is important for policymakers, educators, and researchers alike, particularly in regions as diverse and populous as Ontario, Canada. Leveraging the dataset provided by the Ontario Ministry of Education, which encompasses school information and student demographics, this web page aims to provide the relevant data visualizations on the academic achievement of elementary and secondary students in Ontario, focusing on reading, writing, and mathematics performances. It also provides data visualizations on the correlation of the students' academic achievements with socio-economic factors, like geographic location, household income, first languages, and parents' educational attainment. This could help in analyzing trends and variations in performance and provide insights into the effectiveness of educational policies and practices in addressing learning outcomes. It could also help in identifying potential barriers to educational attainment that could help in coming up with targeted interventions that promote equity and inclusivity in Ontario's education system.</p>

<p>The EQAO, established in 1996, is an independent agency of the Government of Ontario, Canada. The primary role of EQAO is to assess the quality of education in Ontario's publicly funded schools. It conducts province-wide assessments of student achievement in key areas such as reading, writing, mathematics, and secondary school literacy. By administering standardized tests to students across the province, EQAO aims to evaluate proficiency levels, inform educational policies, and drive improvements in teaching and learning practices.</p>

<p>The figure below provides a general overview of the entire data set. Of particular interest are schools in the elementary and secondary level in Ontario. Elementary schools in Ontario vary in their Grade Ranges - JK-8, 7-8, JK-6, JK-2, 1-8, JK-3, 4-8, 6-8, JK-4, 5-8, JK-5, K-8, K-6, K-5, K-7, 1-5, 1-6. Grade levels in secondary schools include 9-12 and 11-12. Elementary and secondary Schools can also fall in one of the following types - Public, Catholic, Hospital, Protestant Separate, and Provincial. The figure also shows the District School Boards that participated in the EQAO assessment tests in elementary and OSSLT in secondary, along with the school counts.</p>

<p>The following table offers an overview of the dataset, featuring the total number of schools as recorded in the raw data. For data visualizations, only those schools with relevant numeric values are included. Schools with non-numeric entries such as 'N/D', 'N/R', 'S.', and null values, as well as those with values of 0 or less, have been excluded. Consequently, our focus lies solely on the count of schools indicated in the 'Total Schools Included' row.</p>
